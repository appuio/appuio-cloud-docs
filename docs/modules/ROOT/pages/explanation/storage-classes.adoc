= Available Storage Classes

This page describes the different storage classes which are available on {product} zones.

NOTE: The available storage classes differ depending on the cloud provider hosting the {product} zone.

== cloudscale.ch

On cloudscale.ch we provide RWO storage using the https://github.com/cloudscale-ch/csi-cloudscale[csi-cloudscale] CSI driver.
Additionally, we provide RWX storage on CephFS managed via https://products.docs.vshn.ch/products/appuio/managed/storage_cluster.html[APPUiO Managed Storage Cluster].
The APPUiO Managed Storage Cluster is deployed on encrypted disks.

The following storage classes are available on cloudscale.ch:

[cols="30%,15%,55%"]
|===
| Storage Class | Access Modes | Description

| `ssd`
| `RWO`
| This storage class provides cloudscale.ch `ssd` volumes.

If you don't require `RWX` storage, we recommend using the `ssd` storage class.

| `ssd-encrypted`
| `RWO`
| This storage class provides encrypted cloudscale.ch `ssd` volumes.

See the xref:how-to/encrypted-volumes.adoc[Setup Encrypted Volumes] guide.

| `bulk`
| `RWO`
| This storage class provides cloudscale.ch `bulk` volumes.

You may want to consider using the `bulk` storage class, if you're working with very large amounts of data but read/write performance isn't critical.

| `bulk-encrypted`
| `RWO`
| This storage class provides encrypted cloudscale.ch `bulk` volumes.

See the xref:how-to/encrypted-volumes.adoc[Setup Encrypted Volumes] guide.

| `cephfs-fspool-cluster`
| `RWX`
| This storage class provides CephFS volumes.

Use this storage class if your application requires `RWX` storage.

|===

[NOTE]
.cloudscale.ch `bulk`
====
Please be aware that you can only provision `bulk` volumes in steps of 100GB, since cloudscale.ch doesn't provide more fine-grained volume sizes for `bulk` storage.
====

[NOTE]
.CephFS encryption
====
The APPUiO Managed Storage Cluster doesn't offer volume-level encryption since the CephFS CSI driver doesn't support volume-level encryption.

=== Performance

We show representative performance numbers (IOPS and bandwidth) for each storage class below.
Please note that we show the best case for write performance here.

Please see the https://products.docs.vshn.ch/products/appuio/managed/storage_cluster_performance_cloudscale.html[APPUiO Managed Storage Cluster] product documentation for an explanation of the benchmarking methodology and a more detailed breakdown of performance numbers.

== Exoscale

On Exoscale, we provide both RWO and RWX storage using the https://products.docs.vshn.ch/products/appuio/managed/storage_cluster.html[APPUiO Managed Storage Cluster].
In the APPUiO Managed Storage Cluster, RWO storage is backed by Ceph-RBD, and RWX storage is backed by CephFS.
The APPUiO Managed Storage Cluster is deployed on encrypted disks.

The following storage classes are available:

[cols="30%,15%,55%"]
|===
| Storage Class | Access Modes | Description

| `rbd-storagepool-cluster`
| `RWO`
| This storage class provides RBD volumes.

If you don't require `RWX` storage, we recommend using the `rbd-storagepool-cluster` storage class.

| `cephfs-fspool-cluster`
| `RWX`
| This storage class provides CephFS volumes.

Use this storage class if your application requires `RWX` storage.

[NOTE]
.Volume-level encryption
====
The APPUiO Managed Storage Cluster currently doesn't offer volume-level encryption.

The CephFS CSI driver doesn't support volume-level encryption, and the RBD CSI driver volume encryption is currently not supported by APPUiO Managed Storage Cluster.
