= Storage Performance

This page presents representative performance numbers for the different storage classes available per {product} zone.
All benchmarks have been done with `kubestr` and were orchestrated with https://github.com/vshn/k8s-storage-bench/[vshn/k8s-storage-bench].

We always show the write performance numbers with no calls to `fsync` during the benchmark run.
