= Fix Long Pod Startup Time (CreateContainerError)

This page describes how you can mitigate very long Pod startup times and `CreateContainerError` for Pods which mount persistent volumes (PVCs) with a large number of files.

== Explanation

When a Pod mounts a volume which contains many files, the Pod startup time can be very long.
This is caused because the container runtime updates the SELinux labels of all the files in the volume on Pod startup.
Depending on the number of files, relabeling can take a long time.

When relabeling takes too long, the Pod goes into `CreateContainerError` status after some time.
When the container is created again, the container runtime continues relabeling files where it left off.
Depending on the amount of files, multiple container restarts are required before the relabeling is done.
Once the relabeling is complete, the Pod will go into status `Running`.

== Implementation

This section explains the steps required to mitigate the long Pod startup times and `CreateContainerError`.

=== Change the Deployment SecurityContext

[NOTE]
====
In this example, a `Deployment` is used, but the same change can be applied to all Kubernetes resources specifying a Pod spec.
====

Set the following `securityContext` in the Deployment using `oc edit`:

[source,yaml]
--
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: [YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_NAME]
  namespace: [YOUR_PROJECT_NAME]
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      securityContext:
        seLinuxOptions:
          type: spc_t
...
--

You can also use `oc patch` to change the `securityContext` of the Deployment:

[source,shell]
--
oc patch deployment [YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_NAME] -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"securityContext":{"seLinuxOptions":{"type":"spc_t"}}}}}}'
--

For more information, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.22/#selinuxoptions-v1-core[SELinuxOptions Spec].

[IMPORTANT]
====
All Pods managed through the Deployment will be restarted.
However, with the modification in place, you should notice a much faster Pod startup time.
