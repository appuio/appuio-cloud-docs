= Choose Node Class

Some zones of {product} provide two or more node classes you can choose from to schedule your workload.
For an explanation of what node classes are and which ones are available, please have a look at xref:references/node-classes.adoc[].

This page will explain how to have workloads scheduled on a specific node class.
This works for all workloads within a given namespace, but it can also be done for a single Pod.
It's also possible to set a node class as default for a namespace, while selected Pods run on another node class.

[CAUTION]
====
Your workload might get stuck with Pods in the `Pending` status with the following error message:

[source]
----
0/X nodes are available: [â€¦] X node(s) didn't match Pod's node affinity/selector.
----

This happens, when you set a node class that doesn't exist on the system.

== Setting Namespace Defaults

You can set the node class on a namespace level by setting the `appuio.io/default-node-selector` annotation on the namespace.
The value of the annotation is a comma-separated list of key-value pairs that are expanded to a node selector.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  annotations:
    appuio.io/default-node-selector: "appuio.io/node-class=plus" <1>
  name: my-namespace
----
<1> The node class to use for workloads in this namespace.

== Setting Workload Node Selector

Single Pods and their controllers can override the node class by setting the `.spec.nodeSelector` field.

Setting a node selector here overrides the namespace default and the cluster default.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-deployment
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-deployment
    spec:
      nodeSelector:
        appuio.io/node-class: plus <1>
      containers:
      - name: my-deployment
        image: my-image
----
<1> The node class to use for this workload.
