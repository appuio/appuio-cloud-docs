= Configure Alert Receivers

{product} allows you to configure custom alert receivers to notify you when an alert is triggered.

This how-to guide shows you alert receivers and routing basics with examples for Slack, Telegram, and email.

== Prerequisites

* Command Line Access to {product}

== Configure Alertmanager

OpenShift uses Alertmanager to manage alerts and send notifications to the correct receiver.

Alertmanager brings different integrations which can be listed by running `kubectl explain alertmanagerconfigs.spec.receivers`.

The basic structure of the Alertmanager configuration is as follows.
Click the links below to see a configuration example for each section:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1beta1
kind: AlertmanagerConfig
metadata:
  name: alert-config
spec:
  receivers:
  - name: telegram
    telegramConfigs: {} <1>
  - name: slack
    slackConfigs: {} <2>
  - name: email
    emailConfigs: {} <3>
  route: <4>
    receiver: default
    routes: []
----
<1> Configuration for Telegram.
See <<alertmanager-config-receiver-telegram>> for more information.
<2> Configuration for Slack.
See <<alertmanager-config-receiver-slack>> for more information.
<3> Email configuration for out-of-office-hours.
See <<alertmanager-config-receiver-email>> for more information.
Configured to only send alerts during out of office hours.
<4> Route configuration.
All alerts are routed to the default receiver.
See <<routing>> for more information.

=== Configure Telegram Receiver [[alertmanager-config-receiver-telegram]]

. Set the namespace the alerts are created in.
+
[source,bash]
----
APP_NAMESPACE=my-namespace
----

. Create a Telegram bot by messaging the https://t.me/BotFather[@BotFather].
See https://core.telegram.org/bots#how-do-i-create-a-bot[Telegram documentation] for more information.

. Create a secret with the bot token returned by the BotFather.
+
[source,bash]
----
TOKEN=<TOKEN> <1>
kubectl create secret generic telegram-alert-bot "--from-literal=token=${TOKEN}"
----
<1> Looks like "123456789:ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABC"

. Find the Chat ID.
+
Add the bot to a group chat, and send a message to the group chat, or message the bot directly.
+
Query the Telegram API to get the Chat ID.
+
[source,bash]
----
curl -X GET "https://api.telegram.org/bot${TOKEN}/getUpdates" | jq '.result[].message | select(. != null)'
----
+
There should be an object with a `text` field that contains the message you sent. and a `chat.id` field.
Save the `chat.id` field for the next step.
+
[source,bash]
----
CHAT_ID=<CHAT_ID>
----

. Create the AlertmanagerConfig.
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl -n "${APP_NAMESPACE}" apply -f - <<YAML
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1beta1
kind: AlertmanagerConfig
metadata:
  name: telegram-alert-config
spec:
  receivers:
  - name: default
    telegramConfigs:
    - apiURL: https://api.telegram.org
      botToken: <1>
        key: token
        name: telegram-alert-bot
      chatID: ${CHAT_ID}
      parseMode: HTML <2>
  route:
    groupBy: [alertname, instance]
    receiver: default
YAML
----
<1> The secret created earlier.
<2> The default parse mode is `MarkdownV2` which doesn't work with the default message template.
Telegram wants every special character to be escaped with a backslash.
HTML works well with the default Alertmanager template.

. Test the receiver. See <<test-alerting>>.

=== Configure Slack Receiver [[alertmanager-config-receiver-slack]]

. Set the namespace the alerts are created in.
+
[source,bash]
----
APP_NAMESPACE=my-namespace
----

. Get the webhook URL from Slack.
+
Go to https://my.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook/, choose the Workspace in the right upper-most corner, select a channel, and click *Add Incoming webhooks integration*.
+
Copy the webhook URL.
+
image::monitoring/alertmanager-slack-webhook.png[Slack Webhook]

. Create a secret with the webhook URL.
+
[source,bash]
----
URL=<URL>
kubectl create secret generic slack-alert-webhook "--from-literal=url=${URL}"
----

. Create the AlertmanagerConfig.
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl -n "${APP_NAMESPACE}" apply -f - <<YAML
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1beta1
kind: AlertmanagerConfig
metadata:
  name: slack-alert-config
spec:
  receivers:
  - name: default
    slackConfigs:
    - apiURL: <1>
        key: url
        name: slack-alert-webhook
      channel: '#alerts' <2>
  route:
    groupBy: [alertname, instance]
    receiver: default
YAML
----
<1> The secret created earlier.
<2> The channel to send alerts to.

. Test the receiver. See <<test-alerting>>.

=== Configure Email Receiver [[alertmanager-config-receiver-email]]

. Set the namespace the alerts are created in.
+
[source,bash]
----
APP_NAMESPACE=my-namespace
----

. Create a secret with the email authentication password.
+
[source,bash]
----
PASSWORD=<PASSWORD>
kubectl create secret generic email-alert-auth "--from-literal=password=${PASSWORD}"
----
+
[TIP]
====
This tutorial sets up SMTP authentication using PLAIN authentication.
CRAM-MD5 and LOGIN are also supported.
See https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/configuration/#configuration-file[Prometheus documentation] for description of the supported authentication fields.
====

. Create the AlertmanagerConfig.
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl -n "${APP_NAMESPACE}" apply -f - <<YAML
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1beta1
kind: AlertmanagerConfig
metadata:
  name: alert-config
spec:
  receivers:
  - name: default
    emailConfigs:
    - to: alerts@example.com <1>
      from: my-app@example.com <2>
      smarthost: smtp.example.com:587 <3>
      authUsername: my-app@example.com <4>
      authIdentity: my-app@example.com <5>
      authPassword: <6>
        key: password
        name: email-alert-auth
  route:
    groupBy: [alertname, instance]
    receiver: default
YAML
----
<1> The email address to send alerts to.
<2> The email address to send alerts from.
<3> The SMTP server to send alerts through.
Alertmanager doesn't support unencrypted connections to remote SMTP endpoints.
<4> The username to authenticate with.
If empty, Alertmanager doesn't authenticate to the SMTP server.
<5> The PLAIN identity to authenticate with.
Can be the same as the username.
Might be omitted for LOGIN protocol.
<6> The secret created earlier.

. Test the receiver. See <<test-alerting>>.

== Routing Alerts [[routing]]

Alerts can be routed to different receivers based on the labels attached to the alerts.

An `AlertmanagerConfig` resource defines a routing tree with a root route and child routes.
The root route is the default route and is used for all alerts that don't match any of the child routes.
The matcher of the root route is set by {product} to match the namespace of the `AlertmanagerConfig`.
All other matchers are ignored.

.The routing tree
[source,yaml]
----
route:
  receiver: default
  routes:
  - match: { team: foo }
    continue: true
  - match: { team: bar }
    routes:
    - match: { severity: warning }
    - match: { severity: critical }
----

The child routes are evaluated in order and the first matching route is used to route the alert.
The `match` field of a route defines the labels that must match for the route to match.
The `match` field can be omitted to match all alerts.

Setting `continue` to `true` on a route will cause the evaluation to continue to the next route.
This can be used to send alerts to multiple receivers.

It's possible to mute alerts during certain times of the day.
This can be done by defining a `timeInterval` and referencing it in the `muteTimeIntervals` field of a route.

.Time intervals
[source,yaml]
----
route:
  muteTimeIntervals: [weekends]
timeIntervals:
- name: weekends
  timeIntervals:
  - weekdays: [saturday, sunday]
----

Alerts can be grouped by labels using the `groupBy` field.
Grouping sends multiple alerts that are similar together as a single notification.

.Alerts grouped by name
[source,yaml]
----
route:
  groupBy: [alertname]
----

See https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/configuration/#route[Prometheus documentation] for more information about routing.

[INFO]
====
Keys need to be mapped from the Prometheus style (snake case) to the Kubernetes CRD style (camel case).

Some fields might not be supported yet by the `AlertmanagerConfig` CRD.
====

=== Example

This example shows how to route alerts to different receivers based on the labels attached to the alerts.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1beta1
kind: AlertmanagerConfig
metadata:
  name: alert-config
spec:
  receivers:
  - name: default
  - name: database-team-slack
  [ ... ]
  route:
    receiver: default <1>
    routes:
    - match:
        team: database
      continue: false <2>
      receiver: database-team-slack
      routes:
      - match: <3>
          severity: critical
        receiver: database-team-pagerduty
        continue: true <4>
    - match:
        team: backend
      continue: false <2>
      receiver: backend-team-slack
      muteTimeIntervals: <5>
      - non-office-hours
      routes:
      - match:
          severity: critical
        receiver: backend-team-pagerduty
        continue: true
    groupBy: [alertname, instance] <6>
  timeIntervals:
  # Monday to Friday, midnight to 9am and 5pm to midnight (UTC) and weekends
  - name: non-office-hours <7>
    timeIntervals:
    - times:
      - startTime: "00:00" <8>
        endTime: "09:00"
      - startTime: "17:00"
        endTime: "24:00"
      weekdays:
      - "monday:friday"
    - weekdays:
      - "saturday"
      - "sunday"
----
<1> The default receiver.
All alerts that don't match any team will be routed to this receiver.
<2> Don't further evaluate the remaining routes.
The alert will be routed to the given team and won't appear in the default "catch-all" receiver.
`false` is the default value and only set for demonstration purposes.
<3> Matches alerts with the label `team=database`, given from the parent route, and `severity=critical`.
<4> Sets this route as an additional receiver for the alert.
The alert will be routed to the `database-team-pagerduty` receiver and the parent Slack receiver.
<5> Mutes the Slack alerts for the back-end team during non-office hours.
When a route is muted it won't send any notifications, but otherwise act normally, this includes ending the route-matching process if the `continue` option isn't set.
<6> The labels to group alerts by.
Grouping sends multiple alerts that are similar together as a single notification.
<7> Defines a time interval that can be referenced in the `muteTimeIntervals` field of a route.
<8> All times are in UTC, no other time zones are supported.

== Test Alerting [[test-alerting]]

All changes to alerting routes and receivers should be tested to ensure that receivers are able to correctly receive alerts.

. Set the namespace you created the `AlertmanagerConfig` in.
+
[source,bash]
----
APP_NAMESPACE=my-namespace
----

. Create a test alert that's always firing.
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl -n "${APP_NAMESPACE}" apply -f - <<YAML
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PrometheusRule
metadata:
  name: test-alert
spec:
  groups:
  - name: test-alert
    rules:
    - alert: TestAlert
      expr: vector(1)
      for: 10s
      labels: {} <1>
      annotations:
        summary: "Test Alert"
        description: "This is a test alert"
YAML
----
<1> Add labels to the alert to route it to the correct receiver.
Usually the default receiver is used if no labels are set.

. Check your configured receivers to see if the alert was received.
+
See <<troubleshooting>> for debugging tips.

. Delete the test alert.
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl -n "${APP_NAMESPACE}" delete prometheusrule test-alert
----

. Repeat the test for all receivers by adding the appropriate labels to the alert.

== Troubleshooting [[troubleshooting]]

OpenShift currently doesn't expose any logs or status information for Alertmanager.
This makes it difficult to debug issues with Alertmanager.
The following section describes some common issues and how to debug them.

. Check all secret references.
+
One missing secret reference blocks the creation of all the receivers in the `AlertmanagerConfig`.

. Check the secret values.
+
Alertmanager may fail to send alerts when the routing configuration has wrong login credentials or missing certificates.
