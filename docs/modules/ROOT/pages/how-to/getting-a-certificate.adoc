= Getting a Certificate through Let's Encrypt 

https://letsencrypt.org/[Let’s Encrypt] is a certificate authority that provides free SSL/TLS certificates via an automated process. 
Their certificates are accepted by most of today’s browsers.

On APPUiO Cloud we provide you with a https://cert-manager.io/[cert-manager] setup which you can use to create, sign, install and renew certificates for your domains running on APPUiO Cloud.

To create a certificate for a FQDN in your domain, you need to create a CNAME record in your domain's DNS pointing to your APPUiO Zone's well-defined `cname` record.

For example in BIND:

[source,dns]
----
www  IN  CNAME  cname.cloudscale-lpg-0.appuio.cloud. <1>
----
<1> The trailing dot is required to stop resolvers trying to resolve the cname with their configured search domains.

You can find the correct target domain in xref:references/zones.adoc[Zones].

[WARNING]
====
Always create an `Ingress` object before pointing a DNS entry to APPUiO Cloud and always remove the corresponding DNS entry before deleting an `Ingress` object for a domain of yours. 
Otherwise someone else could potentially create an `Ingress` object and a Let’s Encrypt certificate for your domain.
====

== Securing an Ingress

A common use-case for cert-manager is requesting TLS certificates to secure your ingress resources.
This can be done by simply adding annotations to your ingress resources and cert-manager will facilitate creating the Certificate resource for you. 

The following example will request a certificate for `example.com`.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-production <1>
  name: myingress
  namespace: mynamespace <2>
spec:
  rules:
  - host: example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - pathType: Prefix
        path: /
        backend:
          service:
            name: myservice
            port:
              number: 80
  tls: <3>
  - hosts:
    - example.com
    secretName: myingress-cert <4>
----
<1> Add an annotation indicating the issuer to use.
<2> Change this to the name of the namespace you want that object to be created in.
<3> Placing a host in the TLS config will determine what ends up in the cert's subjectAltNames.
<4> The created certificate is stored in this secret.

The TLS certificate `Secret` is automatically created by the `Ingress` with `type` set to `kubernetes.io/tls`.
If you need to create the `Secret` yourself, you will have to set the same `type` and set the `data` field with `tls.crt` and `tls.key` values.
If the `Secret` isn't defined with the type `kubernetes.io/tls`, the `Ingress` won't be able to automatically create the corresponding `Route`.

Take a look at the https://cert-manager.io/docs/usage/ingress/[upstream documentation] for further information on how to secure ingresses.

[NOTE]
====
We don't support requesting TLS certificates for OpenShift `Route` objects. 
To use the provided certificate infrastructure, please use the standard Kubernetes `Ingress` object or explicitly create a certificate object.
====

== Issuing a Certificate

You can also use our cert-manager setup for general purpose certificates not directly linked to an `Ingress` object.
This can for example be helpful for terminating TLS directly at the pod.
To do this you'll still need to setup the correct CNAME.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: my-cert
spec:
  dnsNames: <1> 
  - 'my-domain.example.com'
  issuerRef: <2>
    kind: ClusterIssuer
    name: letsencrypt-production
  secretName: my-cert <3>
----
<1> For which domains the certificate will be valid for.
<2> Reference to the issuer to use.
<3> The created certificate is stored in this secret.


The https://cert-manager.io/docs/usage/certificate/[upstream documentation] can give you more details on `Certificate` objects.

== Let's Encrypt Staging Issuer

We highly recommend testing against the Let's Encrypt staging environment and use it for any non-production workloads.
This will allow you to get things right before issuing trusted certificates and reduce the chance of you running up against rate limits.

You can use this Issuer by referencing the `letsencrypt-staging` `ClusterIssuer`. 
For  `Ingress` objects this means changing the `cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer` annotation.
For certificate resources this means changing `.spec.issuerRef.name`.


== Using a Custom Issuer

You have the option to configure your own certificate issuer.
This allows you to securely use a `DNS01 ACME` solver or use any other external issuers. 
A `DNS01` based solver will for example allow you to request wildcard certificates.

Take a look at the https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/[official cert-manager documentation] for an in-depth explanation on issuers.
We give an example configuration for a `DNS01` based issuer using Cloudflare as provider.

[NOTE]
====
If you want to use a `DNS01` solver, the DNS provider for your domain must provide an API which cert-manager can talk to.

See the https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/dns01/#supported-dns01-providers[cert-manager documentation] for a list of supported DNS providers.
====

First make a Kubernetes secret containing a Cloudflare API token with the necessary permissions:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cloudflare-api-token-secret
  namespace: your-namespace
type: Opaque
stringData:
  api-token: <API Token>
----

Then create a new `Issuer` in your namespace referencing the secret.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: custom-issuer
  namespace: your-namespace
spec:
  acme:
    solvers:
    - dns01:
        cloudflare:
          email: my-cloudflare-acc@example.com
          apiTokenSecretRef:
            name: cloudflare-api-token-secret
            key: api-token
----

With this in place you can now create certificates using your custom issuer.
Similarly to using the default issuer you can do this through an `Ingress` or a `Certificate` object.

NOTE: The API token `Secret`, `Issuer`, and `Ingress` or `Certificate` resources must all be created in the same namespace.

For `Ingress` objects  you need to replace the `cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer` annotation with:

[source]
----
cert-manager.io/issuer: custom-issuer
----

Certificate objects will need to reference the local custom issuer instead of the cluster wide issuer.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: my-cert
spec:
  dnsNames:
  - 'my-domain.example.com'
  issuerRef:
    kind: Issuer
    name: custom-issuer
  secretName: my-cert
----

[NOTE]
====
When setting up a custom `DNS01` issuer, you don't need to create a CNAME pointing to the APPUiO Zone and you won't run into any risk of someone else issuing a certificate for your domain
