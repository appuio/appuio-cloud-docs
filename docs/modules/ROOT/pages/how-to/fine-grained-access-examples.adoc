= Fine grained access control examples

{product} allows fine-grained control over which projects a user may access through standard RBAC roles.

This is useful for organizations that have multiple projects and want to restrict some users access to only certain projects.

You can either create https://portal.appuio.cloud/teams[Teams], which show up as an OpenShift group `organization+team` or assign users directly.

The examples below assume the following structure:

[source]
----
mycompany (organization)
├── mycompany-user1 (user)
├── developers (team)
└── operations (team)
----

== Prerequisites for all examples

For this guide, it's assumed that:

* You are logged in to {product} using the `oc login` command.

== User may access only certain projects in the organization [[access-certain-projects]]

[WARNING]
OpenShift has no notion of group hierarchy, so you need to add the user to all groups that should have access to the project.

[INFO]
====
There are two relevant RoleBindings in each Namespace:
* `admin` - allows the user to manage most resources in the Namespace
* `namespace-owner` - allows the user to manage (including delete) the Namespace itself
====

. Remove the user from the `mycompany` organization

. Add the user to the `developers` team
+
The hierarchy should now look like this:
+
[source]
----
mycompany (organization)
├── developers (team)
│   └── mycompany-user1 (user)
└── operations (team)
----

. Allow only organization `mycompany` and team `mycompany+developers` access to your project
+
[source,bash]
----
ORGANIZATION=mycompany
TEAM=developers
PROJECT=mycompany-web-portal

oc -n "${PROJECT}" patch rolebinding admin -oyaml --patch """
subjects:
  - apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    kind: Group
    name: ${ORGANIZATION}
  - apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    kind: Group
    name: ${ORGANIZATION}+${TEAM}
"""
----

.. The user can be referenced directly as well.
+
[source,bash]
----
ORGANIZATION=mycompany
USER=mycompany-user1
PROJECT=mycompany-web-portal

oc -n "${PROJECT}" patch rolebinding admin -oyaml --patch """
subjects:
  - apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    kind: Group
    name: ${ORGANIZATION}
  - apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    kind: User
    name: ${USER}
"""
----

== User may not create new projects in their organization

. Remove the user from the `organization` group

. Add the user to a team that has access to the required projects
+
The hierarchy should now look like this:
+
[source]
----
mycompany (organization)
├── developers (team)
│   └── mycompany-user1 (user)
└── operations (team)
    └── mycompany-user1 (user)
----

. Allow access to the required projects
