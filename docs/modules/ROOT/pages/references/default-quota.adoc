= Default Quota

Every namespace has a set of default quotas and limits configured to protect the {zone} from resource abuse.

== Resource Quotas

The following quotas are configured:

`organization-objects`:: Quotas for counts of non-compute objects such as ConfigMaps and Services.
Check the https://kb.vshn.ch/appuio-cloud/references/quality-requirements/performance/resource-quota.html[system documentation] or use the `oc` command below to see all non-compute resources on which quotas are in place.
`organization-compute`:: Quotas for `NotTerminating` pods.
This includes the number of `NotTerminating` pods and the cumulative resource requests and limits for `NotTerminating` pods.
`organization-compute-terminating`:: Quotas for `Terminating` pods.
This includes the number of `Terminating` pods and the cumulative resource limits for `Terminating` pods.

As described above, we distinguish between `NotTerminating` and `Terminating` pods.
A pod is considered `Terminating` when it has `.spec.activeDeadlineSeconds >= 0`.
Generally, it's considered best practice to configure `.spec.activeDeadlineSeconds` in the `PodSpec` of Jobs and CronJobs.
All other pods are considered `NotTerminating`.

See the Kubernetes https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas[Resource Quotas] documentation for more details on how Kubernetes Resource Quotas work.

TIP: If the default quotas block you from running your application, please contact xref:contact.adoc[{product} support].

== Resource Limits and Defaults

Additionally, {product} enforces minimum and maximum values for some configurations.
These values are checked for each container individually.
Minimum and maximum values are enforced for the following configurations:

* Container CPU requests and limits
* Container memory requests and limits
* Container ephemeral storage requests and limits (only minimum)

NOTE: We enforce minimum values which are greater than zero because Kubernetes interprets zero values for requests and limits as "unlimited"

In addition to enforcing minimum and maximum values, {product} also injects default values for the following configurations if they're not explicitly set:

* Container CPU requests and limits
* Container memory requests and limits
* Container ephemeral storage requests

== Default value for `activeDeadlineSeconds` for "run-once" pods

{product} sets a default value of 30 minutes for `.spec.activeDeadlineSeconds` for "run-once" pods.
"Run-once" pods are pods which have `.spec.restartPolicy` of `Never` or `OnFailure`.
Generally, that's pods created by Jobs, CronJobs, or OpenShift Builds.

Notably, {product} only applies the default value for `.spec.activeDeadlineSeconds` for pods which don't have a value for that field already.
Therefore, if you need a job to run longer than the default 30 minutes, simply set `.spec.activeDeadlineSeconds` accordingly in the Job's pod template.

Additionally, the default value for `activeDeadlineSeconds` can be adjusted per namespace by adding annotation `appuio.io/active-deadline-seconds-override` to the namespace.

[NOTE]
====
This mechanism ensures that all pods created by Jobs, CronJobs and OpenShift builds are considered `Terminating` by the Kubernetes resource quota management.
That means that the `organization-compute-terminating` quota is relevant for pods created by Jobs, CronJobs and OpenShift builds.

== Checking the Quota and Limit values

You can check the actual quotas as follows:

* Via the CLI:
+
[source,bash]
----
oc -n $mynamespace describe quota <1>
oc -n $mynamespace describe quota organization-objects <2>
oc -n $mynamespace describe limits organization <3>
----
<1> Show all configured quotas (`ResourceQuota` objects) in the namespace
<2> Show a specific quota in the namespace
<3> Show the configured limits (`LimitRange` object) in the namespace
+
TIP: The `oc describe quota` command also shows you how much of each quota you're currently consuming (column "Used").

* Check the default values in the https://github.com/appuio/component-appuio-cloud/blob/master/class/defaults.yml#L37[Commodore Component for APPUiO Cloud]
