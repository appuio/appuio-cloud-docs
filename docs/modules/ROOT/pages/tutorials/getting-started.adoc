= Getting Started with APPUiO Cloud

This tutorial describes your first steps with APPUiO Cloud, from signup to your first deployment.

== Step 1: Create an Account

To create your APPUiO Cloud account, open the https://appuio.cloud/register[APPUiO Cloud registration] page. Create your account signing up with your current Google, GitHub, or Microsoft account. The video below shows the registration process.

== Step 2: Login

Login to the https://portal.appuio.cloud/[APPUiO Cloud Portal] using your newly created account.

== Step 3: Add Billing Information and Create an Organization

The first thing you need to do in the https://portal.appuio.cloud/[APPUiO Cloud Portal] is to add your https://portal.appuio.cloud/billingentities/$new?edit=y[billing information, and then to https://portal.appuio.cloud/organizations/$new[create an organization] for yourself and your team.

WARNING: If you don't https://portal.appuio.cloud/user[choose a default organization], you won't be able to create new projects in the OpenShift web console later.

== Step 4: Choose a Zone

In the home screen of the https://portal.appuio.cloud/[APPUiO Cloud Portal] select the link that corresponds to your preferred zone marked as "Console"

If you are more of a command line person, you can also copy the Kubernetes API URL and login using `oc login --server=<url>`.

== Step 5: Get Started with OpenShift

[WARNING]
=====
There is a slight delay (usually less than 3 minutes) between the very first login to a zone and the default organization setup.

During this time you might see error messages like `admission webhook ... denied the request` when creating a new project.
These errors are temporary and will disappear after the setup on the zone is done.
=====

Follow the "Getting Started" instructions of OpenShift; download the command line tools if you haven't already, create a new project, and deploy your first application in just a few steps.

== Step 6: Deploy an Application

Select your preferred programming language to get started; you can either use the OpenShift web console, or, if you are more technically inclined, just launch your preferred terminal and start typing:
