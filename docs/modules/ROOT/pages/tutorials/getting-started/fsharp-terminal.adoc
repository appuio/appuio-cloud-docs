= Getting Started on {product} with the Terminal using F#

// THIS FILE IS AUTOGENERATED
// DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY

image:logos/fsharp.svg[role="related thumb right",alt="Programming language logo",width=120,height=120] This tutorial explains how to run applications written in the F# programming language on {product} using the command line.

If you aren't familiar with issuing commands on a terminal session, you might want to try the xref:tutorials/getting-started/fsharp-web.adoc[Getting Started with F# on the OpenShift Web Console] guide instead.

== Requirements

To follow this guide, please make sure that you have the following tools installed:

`oc`:: You can download the OpenShift command directly from {product}, selecting the help menu (marked as a question mark) and selecting the "Command line tools" entry.

`docker` or `podman`:: You can download them from https://www.docker.com[^] and https://podman.io[^].

`curl`:: Available from https://curl.se[^].

== About the Application

To demo how to run applications written in the https://fsharp.org/[F#^] programming language on {product}, we will use a small demo application using the https://giraffe.wiki/[Giraffe Framework^], bundled as a container thanks to its corresponding `Dockerfile`, and ready to be used on {product}.

You can browse the full source code of this application on https://gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-fsharp[GitLab^].

The "Fortune in F#" application does a few simple things:

* When invoked on the browser, it returns a random number and a funny quote.
* When invoked with an HTTP request including the `Accept: application/json` header, it returns the same information in JSON format.
* Finally, when invoked with an HTTP request including the `Accept: text/plain` header, it returns the same information in plain text format.

Learn more about the `fortune-fsharp` application, including how to edit and build it, on the https://gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-fsharp/-/blob/master/README.adoc[project README^].

=== The Application Router

The code below shows the main router of the application in the F# programming language, located at https://gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-fsharp/-/blob/master/Program.fs[Program.fs^], courtesy of the https://giraffe.wiki/[Giraffe Framework^].

[source,fsharp,indent=0]
--
let fortuneHandler next (ctx: HttpContext) =
    task {
        let obj = { Message = fortune(); Hostname = hostname; Version = "1.2-f#"; Number = random() }
        let header =
            match ctx.GetRequestHeader "Accept" with
                | Error msg -> "text/html"
                | Ok headerValue -> headerValue
        match header with
            | "application/json" ->
                return! ctx.WriteJsonAsync obj
            | "text/plain" ->
                return! ctx.WriteTextAsync (sprintf "Fortune %s cookie of the day #%d:\n\n%s" obj.Version obj.Number obj.Message)
            | _ ->
                return! (razorHtmlView "Index" (Some obj) None None) next ctx
    }

let webApp =
    choose [
        GET >=>
            choose [
                route "/" >=> warbler (fun _ -> fortuneHandler)
            ]
        setStatusCode 404 >=> text "Not Found" ]

=== Run the Container

This step is optional; you can easily test the application locally with Docker:

[source,shell]
--
docker run --rm --publish 8080:8080 registry.gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-fsharp:latest
--

Or with Podman:

[source,shell]
--
podman run --rm --publish 8080:8080 registry.gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-fsharp:latest
--

Now you can test the application with `curl`, for example to get some JSON:

[source,shell]
--
curl http://localhost:8080 --header "Accept: application/json"
--

Or to see a plain text version:

[source,shell]
--
curl http://localhost:8080 --header "Accept: text/plain"
--

You can also open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080[^] to get your fortune cookie of the day.

=== Dockerfile

The application includes a https://gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-fsharp/-/blob/master/Dockerfile[Dockerfile^] ready to build a container fully compatible with OpenShift. The snippet below shows the instructions used to build the actual running image:

[source,dockerfile,indent=0]
--
# Stage 2: runtime image
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:6.0-alpine
RUN apk add fortune
WORKDIR /dotnetapp
COPY --from=build /build/out .
COPY Views /dotnetapp/Views

EXPOSE 8080

# <1>
USER 1001

ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "fortune-fsharp.App.dll"]
--
<1> This explicitly prevents the container from running as root; this is a requirement of OpenShift, and a good practice for images in general.

You can use the `Dockerfile` above to build your own copy of the container, which you can then push to the registry of your choice. Clone the repo:

[source,shell]
--
git clone https://gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-fsharp.git
--

`cd` into it:

[source,shell]
--
cd fortune-fsharp
--

And build your image with Docker:

[source,shell]
--
docker build -t fortune-fsharp .
--

Or with Podman instead:

[source,shell]
--
podman build -t fortune-fsharp .
--

== Step 1: Create a Project

include::partial$login-in-terminal.adoc[]

. Create a new project called "[YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-fsharp"
+
[source,shell]
--
oc new-project [YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-fsharp
--

. To deploy the application we will use a standard Kubernetes `Deployment` object. Save the following YAML in a file called `deployment.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: fortune-fsharp
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: registry.gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-fsharp:latest
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        name: fortune-container
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: fortune-fsharp
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: fortune-fsharp
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: fortune-fsharp
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 8080
      targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    app: fortune-fsharp
  type: ClusterIP
----

. Then apply the deployment to your {product} project:
+
[source,shell]
--
oc apply -f deployment.yaml
--
+
And wait until your pod appears with the status "Running":
+
[source,shell]
--
oc get pods --watch
--

== Step 2: Publish your Application

At the moment your container is running but it's not available from the Internet. To be able to access our application, we must create an `Ingress` object.

. Create another file called `ingress.yaml` with the following contents, customizing the parts marked as `[YOUR_USERNAME]` and `[YOUR_CHOSEN_ZONE]` to your liking (and according to the https://portal.appuio.cloud/zones[Zones documentation page]):
+
[source,yaml]
--
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-production
  name: fortune-fsharp-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: [YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-fsharp.apps.[YOUR_CHOSEN_ZONE].appuio.cloud # <1>
    http:
      paths:
      - pathType: Prefix
        path: /
        backend:
          service:
            name: fortune-fsharp
            port:
              number: 8080
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - [YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-fsharp.apps.[YOUR_CHOSEN_ZONE].appuio.cloud
    secretName: fortune-fsharp-cert
--
<1> Replace the placeholders `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_CHOSEN_ZONE` with valid values.

include::partial$url-length-warning.adoc[]

. Apply the ingress object to your {product} project and wait until you route shows as available.
+
[source,shell]
--
oc apply -f ingress.yaml
--
+
And wait for your route to be ready:
+
[source,shell]
--
oc get routes --watch
--

. After a few seconds, you should be able to get your daily fortune message using `curl` in plain text!
+
[source,shell]
--
curl https://[YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-fsharp.apps.[YOUR_CHOSEN_ZONE].appuio.cloud --header "Accept: text/plain"
--
+
Or in JSON instead:
+
[source,shell]
--
curl https://[YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-fsharp.apps.[YOUR_CHOSEN_ZONE].appuio.cloud --header "Accept: application/json"
--

== Step 3: There's no Step 3!

The "Fortune in  F#" application is now running on {product}. Congratulations! Hit the kbd:[R] key in your keyboard to see a new fortune message, or just wait 10 seconds to get a new one automatically.

What's next? To run your own application written in F# or using the Giraffe Framework on {product}, follow these steps:

* Containerize the application making sure it's compatible with {product}. The `Dockerfile` above can serve as a starting point.
* Enhance the deployment for your application with liveness and health probes, or better yet, create a https://helm.sh/[Helm^] chart.
* Configure your CI/CD system to automatically deploy your application to your preferred {product} zone.

Finally, when you're done testing the fortune application, delete the `fortune-fsharp` project with the following command:

[source,shell]
--
oc delete project [YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-fsharp
--
