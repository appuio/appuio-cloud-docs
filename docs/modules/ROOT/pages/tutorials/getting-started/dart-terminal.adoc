= Getting Started on {product} with the Terminal using Dart

// THIS FILE IS AUTOGENERATED
// DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY

image:logos/dart.svg[role="related thumb right",alt="Programming language logo",width=120,height=120] This tutorial explains how to run applications written in the Dart programming language on {product} using the command line.

If you aren't familiar with issuing commands on a terminal session, you might want to try the xref:tutorials/getting-started/dart-web.adoc[Getting Started with Dart on the OpenShift Web Console] guide instead.

== Requirements

To follow this guide, please make sure that you have the following tools installed:

`oc`:: You can download the OpenShift command directly from {product}, selecting the help menu (marked as a question mark) and selecting the "Command line tools" entry.

`docker` or `podman`:: You can download them from https://www.docker.com[^] and https://podman.io[^].

`curl`:: Available from https://curl.se[^].

== About the Application

To demo how to run applications written in the https://dart.dev/[Dart^] programming language on {product}, we will use a small demo application using the https://www.theconduit.dev/[Conduit Framework^], bundled as a container thanks to its corresponding `Dockerfile`, and ready to be used on {product}.

You can browse the full source code of this application on https://gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-dart[GitLab^].

The "Fortune in Dart" application does a few simple things:

* When invoked on the browser, it returns a random number and a funny quote.
* When invoked with an HTTP request including the `Accept: application/json` header, it returns the same information in JSON format.
* Finally, when invoked with an HTTP request including the `Accept: text/plain` header, it returns the same information in plain text format.

Learn more about the `fortune-dart` application, including how to edit and build it, on the https://gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-dart/-/blob/master/README.adoc[project README^].

=== The Application Router

The code below shows the main router of the application in the Dart programming language, located at https://gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-dart/-/blob/master/lib/channel.dart[lib/channel.dart^], courtesy of the https://www.theconduit.dev/[Conduit Framework^].

[source,dart,indent=0]
--
  @override
  Controller get entryPoint {
    final router = Router();
    final source = File("templates/fortune.html").readAsStringSync();
    final template = Template(source);
    final rng = Random();
    final hostname = Platform.localHostname;
    const version = "1.0-dart";

    router.route("/").linkFunction((request) async {
      var message = "";
      await Process.run('fortune', []).then((ProcessResult pr) {
        message = pr.stdout.toString();
      });
      final random = rng.nextInt(1000);
      final json = {
        'number': random,
        'message': message,
        'version': version,
        'hostname': hostname
      };
      final acceptHeader = request.acceptableContentTypes.first;
      if (acceptHeader.toString() == "text/plain") {
        final text = "Fortune $version cookie of the day #$random:\n\n$message";
        return Response.ok(text)..contentType = ContentType.text;
      } else if (acceptHeader.toString() == "application/json") {
        return Response.ok(json)..contentType = ContentType.json;
      }
      final html = template.renderString(json);
      return Response.ok(html)..contentType = ContentType.html;
    });

    return router;
  }

=== Run the Container

This step is optional; you can easily test the application locally with Docker:

[source,shell]
--
docker run --rm --publish 8080:8080 registry.gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-dart:latest
--

Or with Podman:

[source,shell]
--
podman run --rm --publish 8080:8080 registry.gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-dart:latest
--

Now you can test the application with `curl`, for example to get some JSON:

[source,shell]
--
curl http://localhost:8080 --header "Accept: application/json"
--

Or to see a plain text version:

[source,shell]
--
curl http://localhost:8080 --header "Accept: text/plain"
--

You can also open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080[^] to get your fortune cookie of the day.

=== Dockerfile

The application includes a https://gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-dart/-/blob/master/Dockerfile[Dockerfile^] ready to build a container fully compatible with OpenShift. The snippet below shows the instructions used to build the actual running image:

[source,dockerfile,indent=0]
--
# Build minimal serving image from AOT-compiled `/server` and required system
# libraries and configuration files stored in `/runtime/` from the build stage.
FROM alpine:3.14
RUN apk update \
    && apk add --no-cache fortune ca-certificates tzdata \
    && rm -rf /var/cache/apk/*
WORKDIR /app/bin
COPY --from=build /runtime/ /
COPY --from=build /app/fortune_dart.aot /app/bin/
COPY templates /app/bin/templates

EXPOSE 8080

# <1>
USER 1001:0

CMD ["/app/bin/fortune_dart.aot", "--port=8080", "--address=0.0.0.0"]
--
<1> This explicitly prevents the container from running as root; this is a requirement of OpenShift, and a good practice for images in general.

You can use the `Dockerfile` above to build your own copy of the container, which you can then push to the registry of your choice. Clone the repo:

[source,shell]
--
git clone https://gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-dart.git
--

`cd` into it:

[source,shell]
--
cd fortune-dart
--

And build your image with Docker:

[source,shell]
--
docker build -t fortune-dart .
--

Or with Podman instead:

[source,shell]
--
podman build -t fortune-dart .
--

== Step 1: Create a Project

include::partial$login-in-terminal.adoc[]

. Create a new project called "[YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-dart"
+
[source,shell]
--
oc new-project [YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-dart
--

. To deploy the application we will use a standard Kubernetes `Deployment` object. Save the following YAML in a file called `deployment.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: fortune-dart
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: registry.gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-dart:latest
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        name: fortune-container
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: fortune-dart
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: fortune-dart
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: fortune-dart
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 8080
      targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    app: fortune-dart
  type: ClusterIP
----

. Then apply the deployment to your {product} project:
+
[source,shell]
--
oc apply -f deployment.yaml
--
+
And wait until your pod appears with the status "Running":
+
[source,shell]
--
oc get pods --watch
--

== Step 2: Publish your Application

At the moment your container is running but it's not available from the Internet. To be able to access our application, we must create an `Ingress` object.

. Create another file called `ingress.yaml` with the following contents, customizing the parts marked as `[YOUR_USERNAME]` and `[YOUR_CHOSEN_ZONE]` to your liking (and according to the https://portal.appuio.cloud/zones[Zones documentation page]):
+
[source,yaml]
--
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-production
  name: fortune-dart-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: [YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-dart.apps.[YOUR_CHOSEN_ZONE].appuio.cloud # <1>
    http:
      paths:
      - pathType: Prefix
        path: /
        backend:
          service:
            name: fortune-dart
            port:
              number: 8080
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - [YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-dart.apps.[YOUR_CHOSEN_ZONE].appuio.cloud
    secretName: fortune-dart-cert
--
<1> Replace the placeholders `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_CHOSEN_ZONE` with valid values.

include::partial$url-length-warning.adoc[]

. Apply the ingress object to your {product} project and wait until you route shows as available.
+
[source,shell]
--
oc apply -f ingress.yaml
--
+
And wait for your route to be ready:
+
[source,shell]
--
oc get routes --watch
--

. After a few seconds, you should be able to get your daily fortune message using `curl` in plain text!
+
[source,shell]
--
curl https://[YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-dart.apps.[YOUR_CHOSEN_ZONE].appuio.cloud --header "Accept: text/plain"
--
+
Or in JSON instead:
+
[source,shell]
--
curl https://[YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-dart.apps.[YOUR_CHOSEN_ZONE].appuio.cloud --header "Accept: application/json"
--

== Step 3: There's no Step 3!

The "Fortune in  Dart" application is now running on {product}. Congratulations! Hit the kbd:[R] key in your keyboard to see a new fortune message, or just wait 10 seconds to get a new one automatically.

What's next? To run your own application written in Dart or using the Conduit Framework on {product}, follow these steps:

* Containerize the application making sure it's compatible with {product}. The `Dockerfile` above can serve as a starting point.
* Enhance the deployment for your application with liveness and health probes, or better yet, create a https://helm.sh/[Helm^] chart.
* Configure your CI/CD system to automatically deploy your application to your preferred {product} zone.

Finally, when you're done testing the fortune application, delete the `fortune-dart` project with the following command:

[source,shell]
--
oc delete project [YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-dart
--
