= Getting Started on {product} with the Terminal using Scala

// THIS FILE IS AUTOGENERATED
// DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY

image:logos/scala.svg[role="related thumb right",alt="Programming language logo",width=120,height=120] This tutorial explains how to run applications written in the Scala programming language on {product} using the command line.

If you aren't familiar with issuing commands on a terminal session, you might want to try the xref:tutorials/getting-started/scala-web.adoc[Getting Started with Scala on the OpenShift Web Console] guide instead.

== Requirements

To follow this guide, please make sure that you have the following tools installed:

`oc`:: You can download the OpenShift command directly from {product}, selecting the help menu (marked as a question mark) and selecting the "Command line tools" entry.

`docker` or `podman`:: You can download them from https://www.docker.com and https://podman.io.

`curl`:: Available from https://curl.se.

== About the Application

To demo how to run applications written in the https://scala-lang.org/[Scala] programming language on {product}, we will use a small demo application using the https://scalatra.org/[Scalatra Framework], bundled as a container thanks to its corresponding `Dockerfile`, and ready to be used on {product}.

You can browse the full source code of this application on GitLab:

* https://gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-scala

The "Fortune in Scala" application does a few simple things:

* When invoked on the browser, it returns a random number and a funny quote.
* When invoked with an HTTP request including the `Accept: application/json` header, it returns the same information in JSON format.
* Finally, when invoked with an HTTP request including the `Accept: text/plain` header, it returns the same information in plain text format.

Learn more about the `fortune-scala` application, including how to edit and build it, on the https://gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-scala/-/blob/master/README.adoc[project README].

=== The Application Router

The code below shows the main router of the application in the Scala programming language, located at https://gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-scala/-/blob/master/src/main/scala/ch/vshn/fortune/FortuneServlet.scala[src/main/scala/ch/vshn/fortune/FortuneServlet.scala], courtesy of the https://scalatra.org/[Scalatra Framework].

[source,scala,indent=0]
--
class FortuneServlet extends ScalatraServlet with JacksonJsonSupport {
  protected implicit lazy val jsonFormats: Formats = DefaultFormats
  protected val hostname = "hostname".!!
  protected val version = "1.0-scala"

  def fortune_message() : String = {
    return "fortune".!!
  }

  def random_number() : Integer = {
    return scala.util.Random.nextInt(1000)
  }

  get("/") {
    val number = random_number()
    val fortune = fortune_message()
    views.html.hello.render(fortune, hostname, number, version)
  }

  get("/", request.getHeader("Accept") == "application/json") {
    val number = random_number()
    val fortune = fortune_message()
    contentType = formats("json")
    Fortune(fortune, version, 123, hostname)
  }

  get("/", request.getHeader("Accept") == "text/plain") {
    val number = random_number()
    val fortune = fortune_message()
    "Fortune %s cookie of the day #%d:\n\n%s".format(version, number, fortune);
  }
}

=== Run the Container

This step is optional; you can easily test the application locally with Docker:

[source,shell]
--
docker run --rm --publish 8080:8080 registry.gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-scala:latest
--

Or with Podman:

[source,shell]
--
podman run --rm --publish 8080:8080 registry.gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-scala:latest
--

Now you can test the application with `curl`, for example to get some JSON:

[source,shell]
--
curl http://localhost:8080 --header "Accept: application/json"
--

Or to see a plain text version:

[source,shell]
--
curl http://localhost:8080 --header "Accept: text/plain"
--

You can also open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 to get your fortune cookie of the day.

=== Dockerfile

The application includes a https://gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-scala/-/blob/master/Dockerfile[Dockerfile] ready to build a container fully compatible with OpenShift. The snippet below shows the instructions used to build the actual running image:

[source,dockerfile,indent=0]
--
# Step 2: Runtime image
FROM alpine:3.14
RUN apk add --no-cache fortune bash openjdk11-jre
WORKDIR /fortune
COPY --from=builder /fortune-build/fortune-in-scala-1.0-scala /fortune
EXPOSE 8080

# <1>
USER 1001:0

CMD ["/fortune/bin/fortune-in-scala"]
--
<1> This explicitly prevents the container from running as root; this is a requirement of OpenShift, and a good practice for images in general.

You can use the `Dockerfile` above to build your own copy of the container, which you can then push to the registry of your choice. Clone the repo:

[source,shell]
--
git clone https://gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-scala.git
--

`cd` into it:

[source,shell]
--
cd fortune-scala
--

And build your image with Docker:

[source,shell]
--
docker build -t fortune-scala .
--

Or with Podman instead:

[source,shell]
--
podman build -t fortune-scala .
--

== Step 1: Create a Project

Follow these steps to login to {product} on your terminal, create a project, and to deploy the application:

. Login to the {product} console:
+
[source,shell]
--
oc login --server=https://api.[YOUR_CHOSEN_ZONE].appuio.cloud:6443
--

. Click on the link above to open it on your browser.
. Click "Display token" and copy the login command shown in "Log in with this token"
. Paste the `oc login` command on the terminal:
+
[source,shell]
--
oc login --token=sha256~_xxxxxx_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx-X --server=https://api.[YOUR_CHOSEN_ZONE].appuio.cloud:6443
--

. Create a new project called "[YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-scala"
+
[source,shell]
--
oc new-project [YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-scala
--

. To deploy the application we will use a standard Kubernetes `Deployment` object. Save the following YAML in a file called `deployment.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: fortune-scala
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: registry.gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-scala:latest
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        name: fortune-container
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: fortune-scala
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: fortune-scala
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: fortune-scala
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 8080
      targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    app: fortune-scala
  type: ClusterIP
----

. Then apply the deployment to your {product} project:
+
[source,shell]
--
oc apply -f deployment.yaml
deployment.apps/fortune-scala created
service/fortune-scala created
--
+
And wait until your pod appears with the status "Running":
+
[source,shell]
--
oc get pods --watch
--

== Step 2: Publish your Application

At the moment your container is running but it's not available from the Internet. To be able to access our application, we must create an `Ingress` object.

. Create another file called `ingress.yaml` with the following contents, customizing the parts marked as `[YOUR_USERNAME]` and `[YOUR_CHOSEN_ZONE]` to your liking (and according to the xref:references/zones.adoc[Zones documentation page]):
+
[source,yaml]
--
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-production
  name: fortune-scala-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: [YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-scala.apps.[YOUR_CHOSEN_ZONE].appuio.cloud # <1>
    http:
      paths:
      - pathType: Prefix
        path: /
        backend:
          service:
            name: fortune-scala
            port:
              number: 8080
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - [YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-scala.apps.[YOUR_CHOSEN_ZONE].appuio.cloud
    secretName: fortune-scala-cert
--
<1> Replace the placeholders `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_CHOSEN_ZONE` with valid values.

. Apply the ingress object to your {product} project and wait until you route shows as available.
+
[source,shell]
--
oc apply -f ingress.yaml
ingress.networking.k8s.io/fortune-scala-ingress created
--
+
And wait for your route to be ready:
+
[source,shell]
--
oc get routes --watch
--

. After a few seconds, you should be able to get your daily fortune message using `curl` in plain text!
+
[source,shell]
--
curl https://[YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-scala.apps.[YOUR_CHOSEN_ZONE].appuio.cloud --header "Accept: text/plain"
--
+
Or in JSON instead:
+
[source,shell]
--
curl https://[YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-scala.apps.[YOUR_CHOSEN_ZONE].appuio.cloud --header "Accept: application/json"
--

== Step 3: There's no Step 3!

The "Fortune in  Scala" application is now running on {product}. Congratulations!

What's next? To run your own application written in Scala or using the Scalatra Framework on {product}, follow these steps:

* Containerize the application making sure it's compatible with {product}. The `Dockerfile` above can serve as a starting point.
* Enhance the deployment for your application with liveness and health probes, or better yet, create a https://helm.sh/[Helm] chart.
* Configure your CI/CD system to automatically deploy your application to your preferred {product} zone.

Finally, when you're done testing the fortune application, delete the `fortune-scala` project with the following command:

[source,shell]
--
oc delete project [YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-scala
--
