image:logos/c.svg[role="related thumb right",alt="Programming language logo",width=120,height=120] This tutorial explains how to run applications written in the C programming language on {product} using the OpenShift web console.

If you would rather use the command line, you might want to try the xref:tutorials/getting-started/c-terminal.adoc[Getting Started with C on the Terminal] guide instead.

== Requirements

This tutorial doesn't require anything else than an {product} account and a modern web browser with JavaScript enabled.

== About the Application

To demo how to run applications written in the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C11_%28C_standard_revision%29[C^] programming language on {product}, we will use a small demo application using the https://www.gnu.org/software/libmicrohttpd/[GNU libmicrohttpd library^], bundled as a container thanks to its corresponding `Dockerfile`, and ready to be used on {product}.

The "Fortune in C" application does one simple thing: when invoked on the browser, it returns a random number and a funny quote. That's all!

You can browse the full source code of this application on https://gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-c[GitLab^].

== Step 1: Deploy a Container

Follow these steps to create an OpenShift project and deploy the application:

. Login to {product} and open the "Developer" perspective.
** You can find the link to the {product} web console of your chosen zone in the https://portal.appuio.cloud/zones[{product} Zones] documentation page.
. Create a new project called "[YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-c."
. Click the "+Add" button on the sidebar.
. Select the "Container images" option.
+
IMPORTANT: As explained in xref:explanation/differences-to-public.adoc[this page], not all options in this screen are available in {product}. In particular, it's not possible to choose the "Import from Git" option, as this requires image building capabilities that aren't yet available in {product}.

. In the "Image name from external registry" field, enter the URL of the Fortune in C container:
** `registry.gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-c:latest`
. Change the runtime icon to match the C programming language, the GNU libmicrohttpd library, or any other icon you'd like to use.
. Click "Create."
. After a few seconds, you will see in the "Topology" section an icon representing the "Fortune in C" application running. If you click on it, you will see that there is a "Route" to access the object; it will contain a clickable URL similar to the following:
** `fortune-c-[YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-c.apps.[YOUR_CHOSEN_ZONE].appuio.cloud`
. If you click on it, you will see your daily fortune cookie message!

== Step 2: There's no Step 2!

The "Fortune in  C" application is now running on {product}. Congratulations! Hit the kbd:[R] key in your keyboard to see a new fortune message, or just wait 10 seconds to get a new one automatically.

What's next? To run your own application written in C or using the GNU libmicrohttpd library on {product}, follow these steps:

* Check the xref:tutorials/getting-started/c-terminal.adoc[Getting Started with C on the Terminal] guide for more technical information.
* Make sure your CI/CD system is ready to automatically deploy your application to your preferred {product} zone.

Finally, when you're done testing the fortune application, you can open the "Projects" menu in the "Administrator" perspective and delete the `fortune-c` project, by selecting the appropriate entry on the "Actions" menu.
