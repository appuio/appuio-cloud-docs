= Getting Started on {product} with the Terminal using PHP

// THIS FILE IS AUTOGENERATED
// DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY

image:logos/php.svg[role="related thumb right",alt="Programming language logo",width=120,height=120] This tutorial explains how to run applications written in the PHP programming language on {product} using the command line.

If you aren't familiar with issuing commands on a terminal session, you might want to try the xref:tutorials/getting-started/php-web.adoc[Getting Started with PHP on the OpenShift Web Console] guide instead.

== Requirements

To follow this guide, please make sure that you have the following tools installed:

`oc`:: You can download the OpenShift command directly from {product}, selecting the help menu (marked as a question mark) and selecting the "Command line tools" entry.

`docker` or `podman`:: You can download them from https://www.docker.com[^] and https://podman.io[^].

`curl`:: Available from https://curl.se[^].

== About the Application

To demo how to run applications written in the https://www.php.net/[PHP^] programming language on {product}, we will use a small demo application using the https://www.slimframework.com/[Slim Framework^], bundled as a container thanks to its corresponding `Dockerfile`, and ready to be used on {product}.

You can browse the full source code of this application on https://gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-php[GitLab^].

The "Fortune in PHP" application does a few simple things:

* When invoked on the browser, it returns a random number and a funny quote.
* When invoked with an HTTP request including the `Accept: application/json` header, it returns the same information in JSON format.
* Finally, when invoked with an HTTP request including the `Accept: text/plain` header, it returns the same information in plain text format.

Learn more about the `fortune-php` application, including how to edit and build it, on the https://gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-php/-/blob/master/README.adoc[project README^].

=== The Application Router

The code below shows the main router of the application in the PHP programming language, located at https://gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-php/-/blob/master/public/index.php[public/index.php^], courtesy of the https://www.slimframework.com/[Slim Framework^].

[source,php,indent=0]
--
$app->get('/', function (Request $request, Response $response, $args) use ($version, $hostname) {
    $data = [
        'message' => `fortune`,
        'number' => rand(1, 1000),
        'version' => $version,
        'hostname' => $hostname
    ];
    if ($request->hasHeader('Accept')) {
        $acceptHeader = $request->getHeaderLine('Accept');
        if ($acceptHeader === 'application/json') {
            $json = json_encode($data);
            $response->getBody()->write($json);
            return $response->withHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
        }
        if ($acceptHeader === 'text/plain') {
            $format = "Fortune %s cookie of the day #%d:\n\n%s";
            $result = sprintf($format, $data['version'], $data['number'], $data['message']);
            $response->getBody()->write($result);
            return $response->withHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
        }
    }
    $view = Twig::fromRequest($request);
    return $view->render($response, 'fortune.html', $data);
});

=== Run the Container

This step is optional; you can easily test the application locally with Docker:

[source,shell]
--
docker run --rm --publish 8080:8080 registry.gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-php:latest
--

Or with Podman:

[source,shell]
--
podman run --rm --publish 8080:8080 registry.gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-php:latest
--

Now you can test the application with `curl`, for example to get some JSON:

[source,shell]
--
curl http://localhost:8080 --header "Accept: application/json"
--

Or to see a plain text version:

[source,shell]
--
curl http://localhost:8080 --header "Accept: text/plain"
--

You can also open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080[^] to get your fortune cookie of the day.

=== Dockerfile

The application includes a https://gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-php/-/blob/master/Dockerfile[Dockerfile^] ready to build a container fully compatible with OpenShift. The snippet below shows the instructions used to build the actual running image:

[source,dockerfile,indent=0]
--
# Step 2: Production image
# Adapted from
# https://github.com/TrafeX/docker-php-nginx
FROM alpine:3.17

WORKDIR /var/www/html

# Install packages and remove default server definition
RUN apk --no-cache add fortune nginx php81 php81-fpm php81-json supervisor

# Configure nginx
COPY config/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
COPY config/conf.d /etc/nginx/conf.d/

# Configure PHP-FPM
COPY config/fpm-pool.conf /etc/php81/php-fpm.d/www.conf
COPY config/php.ini /etc/php81/conf.d/custom.ini

# Configure supervisord
COPY config/supervisord.conf /etc/supervisor/conf.d/supervisord.conf

# Setup document root
RUN mkdir -p /var/www/html && mkdir -p /run/ && mkdir -p /var/cache/nginx

# The following lines make this image compatible with OpenShift.
# Source: https://torstenwalter.de/openshift/nginx/2017/08/04/nginx-on-openshift.html
RUN chmod g+rwx /var/cache/nginx /run /var/log/nginx

# Add application
COPY --chown=1001:0 templates /var/www/html/templates
COPY --chown=1001:0 public /var/www/html/public
COPY --from=composer --chown=1001:0 /app/vendor /var/www/html/vendor

# Make sure files/folders needed by the processes are accessable when they run under the 1001 user
RUN chown -R 1001:0 /var/www/html /run /var/lib/nginx /var/log/nginx

# Expose the port nginx is reachable on
EXPOSE 8080

# Switch to use a non-root user from here on
# <1>
USER 1001:0

# Let supervisord start nginx & php-fpm
CMD ["/usr/bin/supervisord", "-c", "/etc/supervisor/conf.d/supervisord.conf"]
--
<1> This explicitly prevents the container from running as root; this is a requirement of OpenShift, and a good practice for images in general.

You can use the `Dockerfile` above to build your own copy of the container, which you can then push to the registry of your choice. Clone the repo:

[source,shell]
--
git clone https://gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-php.git
--

`cd` into it:

[source,shell]
--
cd fortune-php
--

And build your image with Docker:

[source,shell]
--
docker build -t fortune-php .
--

Or with Podman instead:

[source,shell]
--
podman build -t fortune-php .
--

== Step 1: Create a Project

include::partial$login-in-terminal.adoc[]

. Create a new project called "[YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-php"
+
[source,shell]
--
oc new-project [YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-php
--

. To deploy the application we will use a standard Kubernetes `Deployment` object. Save the following YAML in a file called `deployment.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: fortune-php
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: registry.gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-php:latest
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        name: fortune-container
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: fortune-php
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: fortune-php
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: fortune-php
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 8080
      targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    app: fortune-php
  type: ClusterIP
----

. Then apply the deployment to your {product} project:
+
[source,shell]
--
oc apply -f deployment.yaml
--
+
And wait until your pod appears with the status "Running":
+
[source,shell]
--
oc get pods --watch
--

== Step 2: Publish your Application

At the moment your container is running but it's not available from the Internet. To be able to access our application, we must create an `Ingress` object.

. Create another file called `ingress.yaml` with the following contents, customizing the parts marked as `[YOUR_USERNAME]` and `[YOUR_CHOSEN_ZONE]` to your liking (and according to the https://portal.appuio.cloud/zones[Zones documentation page]):
+
[source,yaml]
--
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-production
  name: fortune-php-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: [YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-php.apps.[YOUR_CHOSEN_ZONE].appuio.cloud # <1>
    http:
      paths:
      - pathType: Prefix
        path: /
        backend:
          service:
            name: fortune-php
            port:
              number: 8080
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - [YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-php.apps.[YOUR_CHOSEN_ZONE].appuio.cloud
    secretName: fortune-php-cert
--
<1> Replace the placeholders `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_CHOSEN_ZONE` with valid values.

include::partial$url-length-warning.adoc[]

. Apply the ingress object to your {product} project and wait until you route shows as available.
+
[source,shell]
--
oc apply -f ingress.yaml
--
+
And wait for your route to be ready:
+
[source,shell]
--
oc get routes --watch
--

. After a few seconds, you should be able to get your daily fortune message using `curl` in plain text!
+
[source,shell]
--
curl https://[YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-php.apps.[YOUR_CHOSEN_ZONE].appuio.cloud --header "Accept: text/plain"
--
+
Or in JSON instead:
+
[source,shell]
--
curl https://[YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-php.apps.[YOUR_CHOSEN_ZONE].appuio.cloud --header "Accept: application/json"
--

== Step 3: There's no Step 3!

The "Fortune in  PHP" application is now running on {product}. Congratulations! Hit the kbd:[R] key in your keyboard to see a new fortune message, or just wait 10 seconds to get a new one automatically.

What's next? To run your own application written in PHP or using the Slim Framework on {product}, follow these steps:

* Containerize the application making sure it's compatible with {product}. The `Dockerfile` above can serve as a starting point.
* Enhance the deployment for your application with liveness and health probes, or better yet, create a https://helm.sh/[Helm^] chart.
* Configure your CI/CD system to automatically deploy your application to your preferred {product} zone.

Finally, when you're done testing the fortune application, delete the `fortune-php` project with the following command:

[source,shell]
--
oc delete project [YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-php
--
