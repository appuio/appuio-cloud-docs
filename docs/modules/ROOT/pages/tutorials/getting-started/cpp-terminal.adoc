= Getting Started on {product} with the Terminal using C++

// THIS FILE IS AUTOGENERATED
// DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY

image:logos/cpp.svg[role="related thumb right",alt="Programming language logo",width=120,height=120] This tutorial explains how to run applications written in the C++ programming language on {product} using the command line.

If you aren't familiar with issuing commands on a terminal session, you might want to try the xref:tutorials/getting-started/cpp-web.adoc[Getting Started with C++ on the OpenShift Web Console] guide instead.

== Requirements

To follow this guide, please make sure that you have the following tools installed:

`oc`:: You can download the OpenShift command directly from {product}, selecting the help menu (marked as a question mark) and selecting the "Command line tools" entry.

`docker` or `podman`:: You can download them from https://www.docker.com[^] and https://podman.io[^].

`curl`:: Available from https://curl.se[^].

== About the Application

To demo how to run applications written in the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B17[C++^] programming language on {product}, we will use a small demo application using the https://github.com/drogonframework/drogon[Drogon Framework^], bundled as a container thanks to its corresponding `Dockerfile`, and ready to be used on {product}.

You can browse the full source code of this application on https://gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-cpp[GitLab^].

The "Fortune in C++" application does a few simple things:

* When invoked on the browser, it returns a random number and a funny quote.
* When invoked with an HTTP request including the `Accept: application/json` header, it returns the same information in JSON format.
* Finally, when invoked with an HTTP request including the `Accept: text/plain` header, it returns the same information in plain text format.

Learn more about the `fortune-cpp` application, including how to edit and build it, on the https://gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-cpp/-/blob/master/README.adoc[project README^].

=== The Application Router

The code below shows the main router of the application in the C++ programming language, located at https://gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-cpp/-/blob/master/src/main.cpp[src/main.cpp^], courtesy of the https://github.com/drogonframework/drogon[Drogon Framework^].

[source,cpp,indent=0]
--
int main()
{
    std::string hostname = execute_command("hostname");
    std::string version = std::string(VERSION);
    auto router = [=](const HttpRequestPtr &req,
                      std::function<void(const HttpResponsePtr &)> &&callback)
    {
        std::string fortune = execute_command("fortune");
        int number = random_number();

        std::string accept = req->getHeader("Accept");
        if (accept == "application/json")
        {
            Json::Value json;
            json["hostname"] = hostname;
            json["message"] = fortune;
            json["number"] = number;
            json["version"] = version;
            auto resp = HttpResponse::newHttpJsonResponse(json);
            callback(resp);
            return;
        }
        if (accept == "text/plain")
        {
            std::string result = respond_text(fortune.c_str(), number);
            auto resp = HttpResponse::newHttpResponse();
            resp->setBody(result);
            resp->setContentTypeString("text/plain");
            callback(resp);
            return;
        }
        HttpViewData data;
        data.insert("fortune", fortune);
        data.insert("number", std::to_string(number));
        data.insert("version", version);
        data.insert("hostname", hostname);
        auto resp = HttpResponse::newHttpViewResponse("fortune", data);
        callback(resp);
    };
    app().registerHandler("/", router).addListener("0.0.0.0", PORT).run();
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}

=== Run the Container

This step is optional; you can easily test the application locally with Docker:

[source,shell]
--
docker run --rm --publish 8080:8080 registry.gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-cpp:latest
--

Or with Podman:

[source,shell]
--
podman run --rm --publish 8080:8080 registry.gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-cpp:latest
--

Now you can test the application with `curl`, for example to get some JSON:

[source,shell]
--
curl http://localhost:8080 --header "Accept: application/json"
--

Or to see a plain text version:

[source,shell]
--
curl http://localhost:8080 --header "Accept: text/plain"
--

You can also open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080[^] to get your fortune cookie of the day.

=== Dockerfile

The application includes a https://gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-cpp/-/blob/master/Dockerfile[Dockerfile^] ready to build a container fully compatible with OpenShift. The snippet below shows the instructions used to build the actual running image:

[source,dockerfile,indent=0]
--
# Step 2: Production image
FROM busybox:glibc
COPY --from=builder /builder/build/cpp-fortune /usr/local/bin/cpp-fortune
COPY --from=builder /usr/games/fortune /usr/local/bin/fortune
COPY --from=builder /usr/share/games/fortunes /usr/share/games/fortunes
COPY --from=builder /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2
COPY --from=builder /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgcc_s.so.1 /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgcc_s.so.1
COPY --from=builder /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6
COPY --from=builder /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/librecode.so.0 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/librecode.so.0

EXPOSE 8080

# <1>
USER 1001:0

CMD ["/usr/local/bin/cpp-fortune"]
--
<1> This explicitly prevents the container from running as root; this is a requirement of OpenShift, and a good practice for images in general.

You can use the `Dockerfile` above to build your own copy of the container, which you can then push to the registry of your choice. Clone the repo:

[source,shell]
--
git clone https://gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-cpp.git
--

`cd` into it:

[source,shell]
--
cd fortune-cpp
--

And build your image with Docker:

[source,shell]
--
docker build -t fortune-cpp .
--

Or with Podman instead:

[source,shell]
--
podman build -t fortune-cpp .
--

== Step 1: Create a Project

include::partial$login-in-terminal.adoc[]

. Create a new project called "[YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-cpp"
+
[source,shell]
--
oc new-project [YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-cpp
--

. To deploy the application we will use a standard Kubernetes `Deployment` object. Save the following YAML in a file called `deployment.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: fortune-cpp
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: registry.gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-cpp:latest
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        name: fortune-container
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: fortune-cpp
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: fortune-cpp
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: fortune-cpp
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 8080
      targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    app: fortune-cpp
  type: ClusterIP
----

. Then apply the deployment to your {product} project:
+
[source,shell]
--
oc apply -f deployment.yaml
--
+
And wait until your pod appears with the status "Running":
+
[source,shell]
--
oc get pods --watch
--

== Step 2: Publish your Application

At the moment your container is running but it's not available from the Internet. To be able to access our application, we must create an `Ingress` object.

. Create another file called `ingress.yaml` with the following contents, customizing the parts marked as `[YOUR_USERNAME]` and `[YOUR_CHOSEN_ZONE]` to your liking (and according to the https://portal.appuio.cloud/zones[Zones documentation page]):
+
[source,yaml]
--
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-production
  name: fortune-cpp-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: [YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-cpp.apps.[YOUR_CHOSEN_ZONE].appuio.cloud # <1>
    http:
      paths:
      - pathType: Prefix
        path: /
        backend:
          service:
            name: fortune-cpp
            port:
              number: 8080
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - [YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-cpp.apps.[YOUR_CHOSEN_ZONE].appuio.cloud
    secretName: fortune-cpp-cert
--
<1> Replace the placeholders `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_CHOSEN_ZONE` with valid values.

include::partial$url-length-warning.adoc[]

. Apply the ingress object to your {product} project and wait until you route shows as available.
+
[source,shell]
--
oc apply -f ingress.yaml
--
+
And wait for your route to be ready:
+
[source,shell]
--
oc get routes --watch
--

. After a few seconds, you should be able to get your daily fortune message using `curl` in plain text!
+
[source,shell]
--
curl https://[YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-cpp.apps.[YOUR_CHOSEN_ZONE].appuio.cloud --header "Accept: text/plain"
--
+
Or in JSON instead:
+
[source,shell]
--
curl https://[YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-cpp.apps.[YOUR_CHOSEN_ZONE].appuio.cloud --header "Accept: application/json"
--

== Step 3: There's no Step 3!

The "Fortune in  C++" application is now running on {product}. Congratulations! Hit the kbd:[R] key in your keyboard to see a new fortune message, or just wait 10 seconds to get a new one automatically.

What's next? To run your own application written in C++ or using the Drogon Framework on {product}, follow these steps:

* Containerize the application making sure it's compatible with {product}. The `Dockerfile` above can serve as a starting point.
* Enhance the deployment for your application with liveness and health probes, or better yet, create a https://helm.sh/[Helm^] chart.
* Configure your CI/CD system to automatically deploy your application to your preferred {product} zone.

Finally, when you're done testing the fortune application, delete the `fortune-cpp` project with the following command:

[source,shell]
--
oc delete project [YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-cpp
--
